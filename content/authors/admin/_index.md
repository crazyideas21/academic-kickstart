I am a postdoctoral researcher at Princeton's [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/) and [Center for Information Technology Policy](https://citp.princeton.edu/).

I study security and privacy problems of emerging technologies, such as cryptocurrencies and smart-home IoT devices.

To measure these problems, I develop methods to collect and analyze large datasets from the Internet using techniques from multiple disciplines, such as network analytics, human-computer interaction, and economics.

Impact of my work:

 - Helped law enforcement agencies identify criminals by tracing the flow of cryptocurrencies. See [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-40737060), [Reuter](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trafficking-ads-idUSKCN1AX2RD), [New Scientist](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2145355-ai-uses-bitcoin-trail-to-find-and-help-sex-trafficking-victims/), and [National Public Radio](https://www.kpbs.org/news/2014/feb/28/why-bitcoin-schemers-have-been-hijacking-personal-/).

 - Helped 3,000+ consumers discover possible security and privacy issues on 30,000+ smart home devices by releasing an open-source tool, [IoT Inspector](https://iot-inspector.princeton.edu/). See [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/13/spy-on-your-smart-home-with-this-open-source-research-tool/) and [Gizmodo](https://gizmodo.com/this-simple-tool-will-reveal-the-secret-life-of-your-sm-1832264323).
